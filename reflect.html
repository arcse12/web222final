<p1>I think the concept of responsive website design is that the design and development of pages should be responsive and adjusted according to user behavior and device environment (system platform, screen size, screen orientation, etc.). The specific practices are composed of many aspects, including elastic grids and layouts, images, the use of CSS media queries, and so on. Whether a user is using a laptop or an iPad, our pages should be able to automatically switch resolution, image size, and related scripting features to suit different devices. From my research, the web should have the ability to automatically respond to the user's device environment. Responsive web design is the ability of a website to work with multiple terminals rather than making a specific version of each. That way, we don't have to design and develop specific versions of the new devices that keep coming. I think responsive design USES all the flexible techniques to make the size of the images automatically adjust and the layout of the page not be broken. Whether the user switches the device's screen orientation or switches from a desktop screen to an iPad, the page is truly elastic. Another technique used in responsive web design is responsive graphics, which can display different resolutions and sizes on different screens.</p1>
